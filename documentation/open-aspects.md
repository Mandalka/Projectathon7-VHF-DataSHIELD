## Open Questions and Aspects
- **restrictive vs. permissive mode**: The difference is that the first allows to execute very few remote functions making an analysis nearly impossible, whereas the second necessitates often a non-disclosure-control statement.
    - Which mode of operation (or access and execution mode) should be used is specific at infrastructure level not at project level.

    - We would argue for the permissive mode.
- We need to adapt the available non-disclosure-control for R server package dsBinVal
- What is the overall procedure to get the non-disclosure control accepted locally?
- Versioning of DataSHIELD installation and packages (dsBase and dsBinVal)
